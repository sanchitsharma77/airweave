Airweave is an open-source context retrieval layer that gives AI agents unified search across all your apps, databases, and documents. Instead of wiring each data source separately, Airweave connects directly to all of your existing tools and exposes their data through a single search interface.

Airweave continuously syncs information from connected sources and makes it available as a unified, searchable knowledge base. This allows AI agents to retrieve current, source-grounded context at query time, rather than relying on static embeddings or custom data pipelines that quickly fall out of date.

## Who it's for

Developers and teams building AI agents and other AI-powered applications that need reliable access to information across multiple tools and data sources.

If you're working on long-running AI agents, retrieval-augmented generation, or any context-heavy LLM application, Airweave provides the infrastructure to retrieve and manage context without maintaining bespoke integrations for every data source.

## Use cases

Airweave lets AI agents search across company knowledge bases, cloud drives, databases, and SaaS tools in a single query.

Common use cases include:
