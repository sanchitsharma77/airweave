This connector enables AI agents and RAG systems to retrieve context from Jira through Airweave's unified search layer.

## Configuration

Jira source connector integrates with the Jira REST API to extract project management data.

Connects to your Jira Cloud instance. Optionally integrates with Zephyr Scale
for test management entities (test cases, test cycles, test plans) when a
Zephyr Scale API token is provided.

It provides comprehensive access to projects, issues, and their
relationships for agile development and issue tracking workflows.
