# EMAIL ENTITY SCHEMA
# Inherits from file_entity with no additional fields.
# Email messages are treated as FileEntity with HTML body saved to local file.
# Content is not stored in entity fields, only in the downloaded file.

schema email_entity inherits file_entity {

    document email_entity inherits file_entity {
        # No additional fields - email is essentially a file entity
        # The email content is extracted into textual_representation during sync
    }
