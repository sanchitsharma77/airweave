"""Pipeline components for entity processing.

This module contains the event-driven entity pipeline architecture:

Core Components:
- EntityTracker: Central entity state tracking (dedup + counts + pubsub)

Processing Helpers:
- HashComputer: Computes content hashes
- TextualRepresentationBuilder: Builds textual representations
- CleanupService: Handles orphan and temp file cleanup
